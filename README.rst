Pipline accident data set
-----------------------------------------------

The data are a kaggle data set that was released by the USDOT.

   https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/pipeline-accidents

The `pipeline-accidents.csv` includes a record for each oil pipeline
leak or spill reported to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration since 2010. These records include the incident date and
time, operator and pipeline, cause of incident, type of hazardous
liquid and quantity lost, injuries and fatalities, and associated
costs.

> Because these data are in the public domain we ask that your group
does not use code from any published analyses.

The goal of this exercise is to take the concepts, tools and
technologies that you have learned up until this point and apply them.
